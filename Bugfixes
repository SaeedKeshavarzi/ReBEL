Version 0.2.7 (bugfix)
======================
* Fixed a few small bugs in 'geninfds.m'. These only manifested themselves in 
  certain rare circumstances. 

* Added m2html documentation (provided by Alexei Ivanov)

* Updated to Netlab version 3.3

* rewrote feval calls as function calls

* removed ffun_type and hfun_type from GSSM since they were unused

Version 0.2.6 (bugfix)
======================

* Fixed a number of small bugs in 'geninfds.m'. These only manifested themselves in 
  certain rare circumstances. 

* Updated example code. Fixed bug in dual estimation demo, 'demspeech_dual.m'.


Version 0.2.5 (bugfix)
======================

* Fixed bug in UKF and SRUKF which incorrectly calculated predicted
  observations of angular state quantities. This was once again due
  to a typo in the name of an intermediate variable.

* Measurement update in all SPKF filters that dealt with angular state
  components (i.e. that have discontinuities at +- pi radians) used the
  wrong prior RV for the update. This was due to a typo which is now fixed
  and tested to work correctly.

* Fixed a bug in the Robbins-Monro and Annealing process noise covariance
  adaptation routines in SRUKF and SRCDKF which over estimated the resulting
  process noise covariance.

* Minor updates in example code. Rechecked all examples to ensure 
  compatibility with updated core routines.


Version 0.2.4 (bugfix)
======================

* Converted data MAT files in examples/data directory to new Matlab 6.5 
  (R13.1) format. This should fix the problem of Matlab under Windows 
  reporting that the MAT files are corrupted. This problem was not 
  evident under Linux.
  
* Corrected some out of date inline documentation in the GSSM template
  file, 'gssm.m'. There were also a few errors in the argument lists of
  one or two functions.
  

Version 0.2.3 (bugfix)
======================

* Typo/indexing bug causing run-time error in measurement update for parameter
  estimation in 'srukf.m' fixed.

* Typo/bug in 'ukf.m' and 'cdkf.m' in process noise adaptation method. Used
  field 'InfDS.pNoise.adaptParams' in stead of 'pNoise.adaptParams'. This 
  caused a runtime error. Fixed.


Version 0.2.2 (bugfix)
======================

* Fixed typos in UKF, CDKF, SRCDKF and SRUKF for time and measurement 
  updates of systems that have angular state or observation vector 
  components (see below). A variable name was misspelled which caused a 
  runtime error under certain conditions.
  
* Updated missing optional fields in gssm.m for angular components in state
  or observation vectors
       
       model.stateAngleCompIdxVec
       model.obsAngleCompIdxVec
   
  These two (optional) fields are index vectors indicating which of the system
  state vector components and/or observation vector components are angular
  quantities that have discontinuities at +- pi radians. This is needed for 
  correct operation of all SPKF based inference algorithms.


Version 0.2.1 (bugfix)
======================

* Fixed bug in examples/dual_estimation/demspeech_dual.m : State covariance
  was not correctly reinitialized.
	
* Fixed bug in core/gssm.m : Passed wrong noise variable to state transition
  function in generic perturbation based linearization function.


Version 0.1.1 (bugfix)
======================

* A couple of files where missing from the distribution. These where
  added.

* Added 'addrelpath.m' and 'remrelpath.m'. These functions add and
  remove relative paths from the current MATLABPATH. This is needed
  since relative symbolic links does not work on Windows and cannot
  be stored in CVS. Symbolic links where used (v 0.1) in the example
  directories to point to the needed 'gssm' files and data
  files. These where removed and there functionality where replaced by
  using the above mentioned new functions.
