function [prior, likelihood, evidence, posterior] = gmmprobability(gmmDS, X, W)

% GMMPROBABILITY  Calculates any of the related (through Bayes rule) probabilities
%                 of a Gaussian Mixture Model (gmmDS) and a given dataset X.
%                 'prob_type' is a string indicating which of the four probability
%                 values are needed. These probabilities are:
%
%                      P(X|C) . P(C)                       likelihood . prior
%           P(C|X) = -----------------       posterior =  --------------------
%                          P(X)                                evidence
%
%            where C is the component classes (Gaussians) of the GMM and X is the data.
%
%   probability = gmmprobability(gmmDS, X, W)
%
%   INPUT
%          gmmDS         Gaussian mixture model data structure with the following fields
%            .cov_type   covariance matrix type 'full' , 'diag' , 'sqrt' , 'sqrt-diag'    [string]
%            .dim        data dimension  [scalar]
%            .M          number of Gaussian component densities  [scalar]
%            .weights    mixing priors (component weights) [1-by-M vector]
%            .mu         M Gaussian component means (columns of matrix) [dim-by-M matrix]
%            .cov        covariance matrices of Gaussian components (must comply with .cov_type)
%                        [dim-by-dim-by-M matrix]
%          X             buffer of N dim-by-1 data set vectors to be evaluated  [dim-by-N]
%          W             (optional) 1-by-N vector of sample weights. If specified, the sample
%                                   set will be weighted according to these weights.
%
%   OUTPUT
%          prior         The prior (without seeing data) probability of a component
%                        density generating any given data vector, i.e. P(C(i)).
%                        This is simply the same as the prior mixing weights,
%                        'gmmDS.weights'. [M-by-1 matrix]
%
%          likelihood    M-by-N martrix where the j,i-th entry is the likelihood
%                        of input column vector i (of X) conditioned on component
%                        density j, i.e. P(X(i)|C(j))
%
%          evidence      1-by-N matrix where the i-th entry is the total data probability
%                        for a given data vector X(i), i.e. P(X(i))=sum_over_all_j[P(X(i)|C(j))]
%
%          posterior     M-by-N matrix where the j,i-th entry is the posterior
%                        probability (after seeing the data) that a component
%                        density j has generated a specific data vector X(i), i.e.
%                        P(C(j)|X(i))   (class posterior probabilities)
